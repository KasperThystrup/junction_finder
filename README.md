# Junction Finder
This software is in its earliest development phase. It utilizes blast algorithms to detect very specific junction sites, which in turn can be used to identify highly specific marker sequences of e.g. plasmids.

It takes in a sample directory as input and automatically performs blast on all samples in that folder.
